# Traffic_Generator
## 
A traffic generator program consisting of client-server applications running on end-hosts (or VMs) for generating various workloads of different flows sizes, inter-arrival time and communication patterns.

The code of the client and server applications are written in C, the scripts used for setting up and running the experiments as well are written in Python, Plot scripts are BASH + GNUPLOT.
